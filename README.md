# Earth Strike: Organizational Materials

## Introduction
Many organizational materials - documents, spreadsheets, etc. - have been created to facilitate the internal operations of Earth Strike. To this point, these materials have been scattered in various places - pinned messages on Discord, threads and attachments on Loomio, folders in Google Drive, etc. - where they quickly become lost, forgotten, and out-of-date.

To mitigate this issue, this repository will serve as the central place for storing, accessing, and modifying all necessary resources for our internal operations.

### Why GitHub?
Git is a **version control system**, meaning it is uniquely suited to working on large projects in large teams, while keeping track of all work done in an organized, secure way. GitHub, the associated online storage system, also offers the ability to create, track, and discuss Issues, plan out Projects, assign tasks to people, and more. If you're unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, **that's fine** - check the How to Contribute section at the bottom of this document.

## Contents
Topic-specific materials relevant to our international teams are stored in direct subfolders of the root directory; e.g. `graphics`, `outreach`.

Materials specific to certain national chapters can be found in the appropriate subfolder of the `countries` directory, and should be sorted in a similar way; e.g. US-specific outreach materials can be found in `countries/united-states/outreach`.

When necessary, these country directories will be subdivided further into regions and cities, again with a similar structure. Materials for the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, for example, can be found in `countries/canada/provinces/nova-scotia`.

A brief list of the topic-specific directories and their contents:

### Graphics
**Internal** materials useful to members of the international Graphics Team. Materials intended for public use, e.g. printable and postable graphics, informational documents about Earth Strike, etc. should go in the public [materials-kit repository](https://github.com/earthstrike/materials-kit).

### Structure
Materials related to the ongoing discussion about Earth Strike's organizational structure, including the many restructuring proposals and agreements that have been created and debated at length.

### Outreach
Materials useful to members of the international Outreach Team, including our list of potential outreach targets, letters to send out, and our list of endorsements.

### Social Media
Materials useful to members of the international Social Media Team, including plans for social media outreach, and restructuring plans for Reddit and Discord.

### Website
Materials useful to members of the international Website Team, including the Onboarding Guide and Supersheet. This does not contain the published content and code on the website; a separate repository for these materials will be created soon.

## How to Contribute

If you're new to Git and GitHub, the simplest way to contribute is to create an **Issue**. This is an easy process that will not break anything or cause problems. Give the issue a descriptive title, and then elaborate on what the issue is - what you want to add to the repository, or what changes you want to make to any documents. This issue will be public, and can be referred to and discussed further if necessary. Eventually, one of us will address it formally and make the proposed changes.

If you want to work on the repository directly, your safest bet is to clone it to your computer, make a new branch, commit your changes there, and then submit a pull request. You can find plenty of tutorials online on how to do all of these steps with Git.
