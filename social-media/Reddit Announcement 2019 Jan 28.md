# We have neglected you for too long, /r/EarthStrike.

To this point, 90% of our community engagement and 99% of our organizing discussion has been on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WfEpz88), with admittedly little attention paid to keeping people in the loop elsewhere. There's many reasons I could give for this, but the bulk of it is because we're still a young movement, and still figuring out how we want to organize ourselves. Progress is being made, however, and it's high time we start celebrating it.

hoggboss has addressed, in her post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthStrike/comments/aipukg/ok_earth_strike_subreddit_its_time_we_had_a_talk/), some of the updates we've been planning to make to this subreddit to maintain its purpose - and you might also notice a *slight* change in certain aspects of the subreddit styling. Earth Strike has more of a brand identity now, and we're keeping it coherent as best we can.

But this isn't all that's been happening the past few weeks over at Earth Strike...

# GitHub!

Most of Earth Strike's organizational materials - graphics, documents, spreadsheets, etc. - have been stored very haphazardly, scattered in various places. Pinned messages on Discord, threads and attachments on Loomio, folders in Google Drive, and so on - all places where things quickly become lost, forgotten, and out-of-date.

To mitigate this issue, we are hoping that our new [GitHub page](https://github.com/earthstrike) will serve as the central place for storing, accessing, and modifying all necessary resources for our internal and external operations. As of now, we have two main repositories:

## [Materials Kit](https://github.com/earthstrike/materials-kit)

Our supplementary storage space for all publicly available Earth Strike graphical materials: posters, fliers, brochures, banners, icons, you name it. Also supplied here is a toolkit for creating new materials, including the official Earth Strike Styleguide.

## [Operations](https://github.com/earthstrike/operations)

Our all-in-one compendium of documents and resources created for **internal use** by our various teams in our various chapters. If you want the real scoop on what we're doing and how it's coming along, look no further.

If you have an issue about one of our documents, materials, etc. that you want to raise, GitHub is the perfect place to do it! We have no real guidelines/rules set up for raising Issues, so feel free to flood us with any concerns you might have for the time being.

Speaking of issues...

# Restructuring!

Hoo boy has this issue been fraught with debate over the past couple months. We have made substantial ground, though, and a few of our plans so far are as follows:

## The International Campaign

The role of Earth Strike International, and the various teams comprising it, will remain minimal, and serve at most two primary purposes:

1. as an international media presence, to facilitate communication with activists and organizations on a global level; and
2. to provide resources and assistance for local chapters as they get off the ground.

Beyond this, we so-called "International Organizers" have been taking great care not to stick our noses too much in the organizing efforts of our local chapters, and not to impose our will on those who wish to operate autonomously. As long as you're on board with our message and our [Principles](https://earth-strike.com/about-us#principles) (one of which happens to be Horizontalism) then you're free to run your Earth Strike chapter however you see fit.

We're here to make sure you don't need to reinvent the wheel if you don't want to. (Speaking of which, you should definitely check out [hoggboss' excellent guide to starting and running a local chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthStrike/wiki/getinvolved).)

## Zulip!

Live chat about our internal operations - general organizing tactics, strategies for outreach and social media, the website, etc. - will **likely** be moving away from Discord, to a platform called [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com). Zulip is a **free, open-source** alternative to Slack and Discord with a unique, powerful threading model that is perfectly suited to organized discussion.

There's a reason Zulip advertises itself as "the most productive team chat". A few of us have tried it out in testing, and it is AMAZING. We're currently setting up the server as we speak, and I for one am super excited.

For those who have (somehow) become attached to our International Discord Server, don't fret. If we do make the switch, the Discord server will stay, as the place to go for general, casual chat, inviting your friends, sharing memes, and arguing about the same five political topics on a weekly rotation. We've made great strides in re-organizing and beautifying the server, and we're not going to let all of that go to waste.

# The Website Map

We over at the Website Team have BIG PLANS for the map system, which is currently on our website in a half-implemented (but still usable) state.

Our global map, the [Campaigns Map](https://earth-strike.com/map), will eventually serve as the **primary landing spot** for people to find their local chapter. Icons on this map link to **Local Pages**, which each national, regional, and municipal Earth Strike chapter will eventually have.

A Local Page will contain all information deemed necessary by organizers on the local level, and they will also get their own special **Events Maps**, where people can find upcoming Earth Strike events in their area. Certain National and Regional Pages will also find it convenient to have an additional map, analogous to the global Campaigns Map, that links to pages for cities in their area.

For more information on what kinds of things you'll find on Local Pages, you can take a peek behind the curtain at our [Website Team Onboarding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UNPA9QiTaWF5vGD7P-cuVJpjTpoPtID-JMCgVdWbkQ4/edit#heading=h.wkqtdrlqry3u).

While the International Website Team recognizes that a centralized global website is a necessary resource to keep our organization tight and cohesive, we also understand the need for national, regional and municipal campaigns to operate autonomously. We hope that this solution will be satisfactory for everyone. Stay tuned!

# Conclusion

Earth Strike is still growing daily, and our community is as vibrant and alive as ever. Let's keep this good thing going!!
